# convert.py

A Python script designed to work alongside **Scrab-NSFW**'s [SL Scene Builder](https://github.com/Scrabx3/SexLab-Scene-Builder) to streamline bulk conversion of SLAL animation packs to SLSB format, ensuring enhanced compatibility with **Scrab**'s [SL PPlus 2.0+](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/25318-sexlab-p/).

Originally created and maintained by **ponzipyramid** with parser improvements from **MissCorruption** (see commit history [here](https://github.com/Scrabx3/SexLab-Scene-Builder/commits/master/scripts/convert.py)), the script's ongoing development has been primarily managed by me through [Scrab's Discord](https://discord.gg/JPSHb4ebqj), enabling me to maintain and update the `Automated SLSB Conversions`.

To begin using the conversion tool, please refer to the following guide: [slal_to_slsb_guide](https://github.com/BabyImpala/convert.py/blob/main/slal_to_slsb_guide.md).
